# Baselator
Assignment 3 from my Computer Organization and Assembly class, the goal was to convert a number in base 10 into bases 1-64 and base 256 using MSP430 assembly only. I had to copy and paste this code because  I do not have the ability to publish the private assignment files from this course, that is why there is no version history.
